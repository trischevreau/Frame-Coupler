### VIDEO FRAME COUPLER

### running parameters (can be changed in the run_parameters.py file) :
### user info level = 3/3 ; save = True
### Tesseract EXE filepath C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe

### [c] how many videos to couple ? 2
### [c] between how many frames should we perform OCR ? (1 means every frame, 2 means every other frame, etc.) 27
### [c] select the filepath of the videos
### [c] input the absolute filepath of video 1 : c:/images_dic/c2/1.mp4
### [i] video 0 is c:/images_dic/c2/1.mp4
### [c] input the absolute filepath of video 2 : c:/images_dic/c2/2.mp4
### [i] video 1 is c:/images_dic/c2/2.mp4
### [c] where do you want to output the results (absolute path) ? c:/images_dic/c2/res
### [i] results folder is c:/images_dic/c2/res

### STEP 1 : Conversion to frames

### [c] it seems like the videos were already converted to gray frames, is it correct ? (Y/n) 
### [i] skipping step 1

### STEP 2 : raw OCR

[step2][i] beginning OCR of frames from folder c:/images_dic/c2/1
[step2][i] choose a crop frame (see opened window)

### STEP 3 : clock fitting

[step3][i] raw OCR results loaded from c:/images_dic/c2/1
[step3][i][001/144] 00:00:03.036 becomes 3036 ms
[step3][i][002/144] 00:00:03.253 becomes 3253 ms
(...)
[step3][i][143/144] 00:00:34.984 becomes 34984 ms
[step3][i][144/144] 00:00:35.201 becomes 35201 ms
[step3][i] computed 144 values.
[step3][w] 13 values were unreadable
[step3][w] 1 values were obviously too high
[step3][w] there is 130 values left
[step3][w] 0 values were discarded on iter 1 with threshold 2000
[step3][w] there is 130 values left
[step3][w] 0 values were discarded on iter 2 with threshold 500
[step3][w] there is 130 values left
[step3][w] 0 values were discarded on iter 3 with threshold 100
[step3][w] there is 130 values left
[step3][r] average sampling frequency : 4.445386809763284 Hz with sigma 6.026098258984974e-14 Hz

### STEP 4 : frame coupling

[step4][i] clock fitting results loaded
[step4][i] there is 30432.053433018973 ms in common starting from 3765.755422954779 ms
[step4][i][1/100] with threshold 0.01, found 10 common frames
[step4][i][2/100] with threshold 0.011497569953977356, found 11 common frames

[step4][i][100/100] with threshold 10000.0, found 10960 common frames

[step4][c] choose a threshold for the frame coupling (ms) : 1

[step4][i] created saving folders

[step4][i] this represents :
